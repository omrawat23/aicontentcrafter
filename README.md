## User Experience & Interface Flow

1. **Landing on the Dashboard:**
   Once logged in, users land on a dashboard where they can browse various coding assistant templates, categorized by technology stack and development need.

2. **Selecting a Template:**
   Users can select a template based on their requirements. For example, choosing the "Node.js Code Assistant" opens a page where they can input their code or query and receive AI-generated suggestions on the right side of the screen.

3. **Generating AI Responses:**
   After inputting their query, users can click “Generate Content,” and the AI provides detailed suggestions or solutions, which they can edit or copy directly.

4. **Membership Management & Settings:**
   Users can manage their account settings, track billing history, and upgrade their membership or buy additional credits for extended usage.
